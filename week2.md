I have been following James Turrell work for a while now. I had the chance to see a couple of his artworks in different places. I was very surprised of the result and atmosphere that they usually provoke. Both of them made me extremely curious about how they were built. Because I have a background in lighting design, it is generally easy for me to discover how lighting installations work. But this was not the case with James Turrell, since he is great at hiding the source of light and only using the reflection of the colors and intensities in the spaces he uses.

Many of this effects I assumed they were only possible thanks to electricity. But amazingly enough, the work of Wang Guangle also achieves very interesting ‘light’ effects with just paint and a canvas in a two dimensional space. Even though the mediums are completely different, both artists are able to produce magical effects that trick the eye.
