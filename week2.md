I have been following James Turrell work for a while now. I had the chance to see a couple of his artworks in different places. I was very surprised of the result and atmosphere that they usually provoke. Both of them made me extremely curious about how they were built. Because I have a background in lighting design, it is generally easy for me to discover how lighting installations work. But this was not the case with James Turrell, since he is great at hiding the source of light and only using the reflection of the colors and intensities in the spaces he uses.

Many of this effects I assumed they were only possible thanks to electricity. But amazingly enough, the work of Wang Guangle also achieves very interesting ‘light’ effects with just paint and a canvas in a two dimensional space. Even though the mediums are completely different, both artists are able to produce magical effects that trick the eye.


## A range of bodies
### Week 3 - The Body/Identity

#### The body as ballistic gel
This week's gallery route impressed me on the large array of very different ways to represent the body. The first artwork I encountered was the one that stuck most in my mind and also my favorite. A ballistics gel pierced by two confronting bullets produced by The Propeller Group. I was amazed on how they were able to freeze an extremely fast action. Guns and bullets are something that usually people do not encounter so often (or I wish that they wouldn't). And if you do, at least in my experience, is through a flat screen. What you can really see about a gunshot is sometimes the shooter, the outcome or both. You can see blood, a wound, the weapon, but you never get to see the bullet itself, even less an exploding one.

I feel that the screen on top showing the process could've been avoided so that the gel was the main actor of the show. But in this case, it was helpful to understand the context of the bullets. At first I wouldn't have noticed that they were two confronting shots, but the slow motion video was clear enough to understand what was below. I feel that this kind of artworks are not only interesting but an actual need considering the actual for the actual world.
