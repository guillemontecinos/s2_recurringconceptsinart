I have been following James Turrell work for a while now. I had the chance to see a couple of his artworks in different places. I was very surprised of the result and atmosphere that they usually provoke. Both of them made me extremely curious about how they were built. Because I have a background in lighting design, it is generally easy for me to discover how lighting installations work. But this was not the case with James Turrell, since he is great at hiding the source of light and only using the reflection of the colors and intensities in the spaces he uses.

Many of this effects I assumed they were only possible thanks to electricity. But amazingly enough, the work of Wang Guangle also achieves very interesting ‘light’ effects with just paint and a canvas in a two dimensional space. Even though the mediums are completely different, both artists are able to produce magical effects that trick the eye.


## A range of bodies
### Week 3 - The Body/Identity

#### The body as ballistic gel
This week's gallery route impressed me on the large array of very different ways to represent the body. The first artwork I encountered was part of *Borders* by different artists. The one that stuck most in my mind and also my favorite one. A ballistics gel pierced by two confronting bullets produced by The Propeller Group. I was amazed on how they were able to freeze an extremely fast moment. Guns and bullets are something that usually people do not encounter so often (or I wish that they wouldn't). But if you do, at least in my experience, is through a flat screen. What you can really see about a gunshot is sometimes the shooter, the outcome or both. You can see blood, a wound, the weapon, but you never get to see the bullet itself, even less an exploding one.

I feel that the screen on top showing the process could've been avoided so that the gel was the main actor of the show. But in this case, it was helpful in order to understand the context of the bullets. At first I wouldn't have noticed that they were two confronting shots, but the slow motion video was clear enough to understand what was below. I feel that this kind of artwork is not only interesting but an actual need considering the time we are living.

### The body as an artifact
This show was also one of my favorite ones of the route. In this case, I felt that every artwork was a relevant piece for the whole. *Pure, Very, New* show by Paul Stephen Benjamin was a great example of how repetition helps to reinforce a message. Literally, the first image that you encounter are the multiple TV's broadcasting Nina Simone singing "Black is the color" over and over again. Even without looking, the song could be heard throughout the entire show. In this case, the body is represented with various media. A video, a flag, photographs and fluorescent black light tubes. With the same discourse, the artist is able to tell us a story many times on these different media. Every piece needed some time to appreciate. At first, the black United State's flag appeared as a simple hanging fabric. From afar, the photographs looked like black squares. But with some time and proximity you were able to discover the faces within. In contrast to *Lynette Yiadom-Boayke* paintings, I wasn't able to engage as much as the previous show. I didn't like so much the technique of the paintings and the scenery they showed. Maybe this is due to a lack of context in this case, but comparing to the other two, I felt that this show needed more time to engage with.

### The body as a portrait
Lastly *Joan Semmel* paintings did achieve what I expect from a painting. The colors of each piece as the whole collection were a perfect balance between natural colors and very saturated ones. I really liked how the artist was able to portrait the body in a very accurate but expressive way. The color of the skins and the background of each painting were very pleasing for the eye. As a collection I appreciate how each of them had some common elements, such as the blue ring on the subject's hand. Even though the colors weren't realistic, the shape of the bodies did actually feel like real. You could tell they were accurate to a middle-aged woman which body doesn't look like a mannequin. Nowadays the woman body in public spaces is extremely idealized and apart from reality, so each new representation that is closer to reality is appreciated.
